// lib/router/request-fault.ts — is the request itself what the upstream refused?
//
// The root route tries the next target when one fails. For most failures that
// is right: the account is out of credit, the upstream is down. But when the
// upstream says the request itself is malformed (400), too large (413) or
// cannot be processed (422), the next target gets the same request — and the
// client waits for every one of them to say no.
//
// The line is drawn narrowly. A 400 that is about the model ("no such model",
// "the model is not in this key's group", a limit the model does not allow)
// depends on the target: another target serves another model, so those still
// move on, the way they always have.
